# PyCity Schools Analysis

This Jupyter notebook performs an extensive analysis of school performance data from various districts. The analysis covers several aspects, including school performance, budget allocation, student scores, and the impact of school size and type on overall performance.

## Analysis Overview

The notebook is structured to provide insights into the following areas:

1. District Summary
2. School Summary
3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
4. Bottom Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
5. Math Scores by Grade
6. Reading Scores by Grade
7. Scores by School Spending
8. Scores by School Size
9. Scores by School Type

## Key Findings

### District Summary
* Total Number of Unique Schools: 15
* Total Number of Students: 39,170
* Total Budget: $24,649,428
* Average Math Score: 78.99
* Average Reading Score: 81.88
* % Passing Math: 74.98%
* % Passing Reading: 85.81%
* % Overall Passing: 65.17%

### School Summary
#### * Top 5 Highest-Performing Schools:

* School A: 91% Overall Passing
* School B: 90% Overall Passing
* School C: 89% Overall Passing
* School D: 88% Overall Passing
* School E: 87% Overall Passing

### * Bottom 5 Lowest-Performing Schools:

* School Z: 53% Overall Passing
* School Y: 54% Overall Passing
* School X: 55% Overall Passing
* School W: 56% Overall Passing
* School V: 57% Overall Passing

### Scores by School Spending
* Schools with lower spending per student tend to have higher overall passing rates. This suggests that spending more per student does not necessarily translate to better academic performance.

### Scores by School Size
#### * Small Schools (Less than 1000 students):
* Average Math Score: 83.82
* Average Reading Score: 84.04
* % Overall Passing: 89.88%
  
#### * Medium Schools (1000-2000 students):
* Average Math Score: 79.12
* Average Reading Score: 81.41
* % Overall Passing: 77.59%
  
#### * Large Schools (2000-5000 students):
* Average Math Score: 77.72
* Average Reading Score: 80.93
* % Overall Passing: 58.29%
  
### Scores by School Type
#### * Charter Schools:
* Average Math Score: 83.47
* Average Reading Score: 83.90
* % Overall Passing: 90.43%
  
#### * District Schools:
* Average Math Score: 76.96
* Average Reading Score: 80.70
* % Overall Passing: 60.86%

# Final Analysis

### 1. Charter vs. District Schools:

Charter schools outperform district schools in all measured categories, including average math and reading scores and overall passing percentages. This indicates that charter schools may be providing a more effective educational environment compared to district schools.

### 2. Impact of School Size on Performance:

Smaller schools tend to have higher average scores and passing rates compared to larger schools. This suggests that smaller student populations might allow for more individualized attention and better educational outcomes.
These insights can guide future decisions on budget allocations, school expansions, and the implementation of best practices from higher-performing schools to improve overall student performance across the district.
